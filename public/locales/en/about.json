  "about": "About Big Dipper",
  "description": "Big Dipper is an open-source block explorer and token management tool serving over 10 proof-of-stake blockchains. It has been forked more than 100 times on GitHub and has served audiences from 140 countries and regions.\n\nBig Dipper started as a Cosmos community project in 2018. It was designed as an explorer tool for blockchains that are based on Cosmos SDK, providing optimal user experience with near real-time on-chain data. Big Dipper utilizes different endpoints from Tendermint, Cosmos SDK and the Command Line Interface to aggregate data into a single web interface.\n\nIn 2020, Big Dipper begins to build explorer tools for various protocols such as Celo and Flow. It is a new but exciting adventure for Big Dipper. In this process, we have gradually shaped the modular-based developing strategy, through which Big Dipper will have more flexibility to support different  blockchains in the future. We build each feature as a component that can be added or structured according to the needs of a certain blockchain.\n\nThe core developer of Big Dipper is Forbole, an experienced staking-as-a-service provider and long-term contributor in blockchain space. Forbole has a strong background in network infrastructure, software development and UX design, and our goal with Big Dipper is to build an easy-to-use crypto asset management tool for every crypto enthusiast. Your feedback and suggestions are always appreciated!"
